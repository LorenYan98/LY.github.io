About myself
===
Loren started the Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering (Structure) from McGill in September 2016. He has accumulated hands-on experience in structural modeling and gained insights into finite element analysis during his two research experiences at McGill University. For the last year of the undergraduate study, he cooperated with other undergraduates and a professional engineer to work on the part of the Cogswell Redevelopment Program and gained exposure to various engineering topics including bridge design check, pedestrian bridge design, bridge rehabilitation, and construction staging study.
