   * Contributed to the design software ‘DesignCheck2’, applied my coding skills with C# via Visual Studio Code to create [a comprehensive check for a W-section element](https://lorenyan98.github.io/LY.github.io/portfolio/2021-03-08-designcheck/) in accordance with Canadian Code CSA S16-14. 


* **2020.05 – 2020.08**  
   **WSP** (Toronto, ON, Canada) **Structural engineer intern**, 
   * Worked with the Civil infrastructure department on a bridge design as part of my internship program
   * Learned to use different softwares such as Revit, Sketchup and bluebeam as part of the BIM team
   * Partook in the operation of a BIM design portfolio for the Cogswell project, which included designing, rendering, attending meetings with stakeholders and on site inspections to update the BIM design


* **2019.05 – 2019.06**  
   **ShuiShi Design** (Shanghai, China) **CAD technician intern**,
  * Designed an entrance and a glass awning for the garage. Created the design plan with AutoCAD and their 3D models with SketchUp. Presented the design methodology to the supervisor through PowerPoint.
  * Handled report and document tracking, project documentation, invoice/agreement verification and building permit applications. On-site visit with colleagues and wrote the report.
 

_Research experience_
====== 
* **2019.08 – 2019.12**  
  **Framework for seismic fragilities for wood structures** (McGill University), 
    * Investigated the mechanism of damage-index based fragility analysis through the definition based on the formula.
       * P\left[d_s\geq C\vert S_a\right]=\phi\left[\frac{\ln(S_d)-\ln(S_{d,ds})}{\sqrt{\beta_c^2+\beta_d^2+\beta_m^2}}\right]
    * Extracted seismic data of a full-scale shake table test on a wood structure from NEESWood Project (2007) and utilized the data to calibrate the Damage Index model.
    * Determined potential factors influencing seismic responses of light-frame wood structures by analyzing their fragility curves via different retrofit strategies.
    * Supervisor: Luc E Chouinard


* **2019.04 – 2019.11**  
  **Pushover analysis for reinforced concrete structures** (McGill University), 
    * Constructed the 3D-model for a three-story reinforced concrete building (Richmond, BC) with SAP2000
    * Performed Pushover analysis on the structure subjected to different earthquake levels; Statistically analyzed the data collected and their corresponding capacity spectrum, using SAP2000 to determine the seismic resistance of the structure.
    * Identified and analyzed potential restraints regarding the Pushover analysis and cooperated the capacity spectrum method with it to optimize the prediction of responses for high-mode buildings.


_Project experience_
====== 
* **2020.01 – 2020.05**   
    [**Capstone Design Project**](https://lorenyan98.github.io/LY.github.io/portfolio/2020-05-01-designproject/) (McGill University), 
    * Designed a steel truss cage to hold the pedestrian bridge spanning Cogswell Street which will enable the removal of the central support column. While minimizing deflection of the glass exterior & water pipes located on the bridge roof.
    * Drafted construction stages and section views of the bridge& steel cage showing the connection details with SketchUp.
    * Built SAP2000 model to analyze the structural response under different load cases; Using Auto-section function to select the proper size of HSS steel trusses based on the CSA S6-14 standard.

* **2019.06 – 2019.08**     
   **Sustainable Design Fair** (Stanford University)
   * Iterated designs and built prototypes of an advanced capsule hotel with SketchUp to engineer its structure for optimizing the occupancy of the area and meeting national safety standards; rendered the 3D model with Vray to present the design in the fair.
