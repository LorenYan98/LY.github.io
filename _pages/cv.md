_Education_
======
* **B.S. in Civil Engineering, McGill University**, **2016.09 -2020.12**
  * **GPA: 3.75 /4.00 (Major GPA 3.87 /4.00)**   Dean’s Honor List (top 10%)


_Work experience_
======
* **2021.01 – present**  
   **Arup** (Toronto, ON, Canada) **Structural engineer intern**, 
   * Responsible for the calculation reports, review of drawings, method statements related to the Firehall project (Toronto)
   * Collaborated with colleagues in Arup London office in the Whiteboard Project (Dublin), performed a detailed design report for steel beams at School Macroom based on the EuroCode.
   * Contributed to the design software ‘DesignCheck2’, applied my coding skills with C# via Visual Studio Code to create a comprehensive check for a W-section element in accordance with Canadian Code CSA S16-14. 


* **2020.05 – 2020.08**  
   **WSP** (Toronto, ON, Canada)**Structural engineer intern**, 
   * Worked with the Civil infrastructure department on a bridge design as part of my internship program
   * Learned to use different softwares such as Revit, Sketchup and bluebeam as part of the BIM team
   * Partook in the operation of a BIM design portfolio for the Cogswell project, which included designing, rendering, attending meetings with stakeholders and on site inspections to update the BIM design


* **2019.05 – 2019.06** 
   **ShuiShi Design** (Shanghai, China) **CAD technician intern**, 
  * Designed an entrance and a glass awning for the garage. Created the design plan with AutoCAD and their 3D models with SketchUp. Presented the design methodology to the supervisor through PowerPoint.
  * Handled report and document tracking, project documentation, invoice/agreement verification and building permit applications. On-site visit with colleagues and wrote the report.
 

_Research experience_
====== 
* **2019.08 – 2019.12**  
  **Framework for seismic fragilities for wood structures** (McGill University), 
    * Investigated the mechanism of damage-index based fragility analysis.
    * Extracted seismic data of a full-scale shake table test on a wood structure from NEESWood Project (2007) and utilized the data to calibrate the Damage Index model.
    * Determined potential factors influencing seismic responses of light-frame wood structures by analyzing their fragility curves via different retrofit strategies.
    * Supervisor: Luc E Chouinard


* **2019.04 – 2019.11**  
  **Pushover analysis for reinforced concrete structures** (McGill University), 
    * Constructed the 3D-model for a three-story reinforced concrete building (Richmond, BC) with SAP2000
    * Performed Pushover analysis on the structure subjected to different earthquake levels; Statistically analyzed the data collected and their corresponding capacity spectrum, using SAP2000 to determine the seismic resistance of the structure.
    * Identified and analyzed potential restraints regarding the Pushover analysis and cooperated the capacity spectrum method with it to optimize the prediction of responses for high-mode buildings.


_Project experience_
====== 
* **2020.01 – 2020.05**
    **Capstone Design Project**(McGill University), 
    * Designed a steel truss cage to hold the pedestrian bridge spanning Cogswell Street which will enable the removal of the central support column. While minimizing deflection of the glass exterior & water pipes located on the bridge roof.
    * Drafted construction stages and section views of the bridge& steel cage showing the connection details with SketchUp.
    * Built SAP2000 model to analyze the structural response under different load cases; Using Auto-section function to select the proper size of HSS steel trusses based on the CSA S6-14 standard.
