Introduction
---
The segment of the project from WSP that has been given to us involves the deconstruction of an on-ramp and the re-structuring of a pedestrian bridge linking a commercial building on the north side and a parking garage on the south side. The pedestrian bridge is made of concrete and is supported by a central concrete column. The re-structuring of the bridge involves deconstructing of the central concrete column. The bridge has glass windows that must be preserved. The bridge spans 35.6m and is 10.3m above street level. A functioning water pipe is locating on top of the bridge that must remain operational at all time. Disruption to pedestrian and street traffic must be minimised.

Project Objective
---
Our Group has been given requirements and constraints regarding the execution of the project. These factors shaped the design process of the bridge leading up to the final design. It also affected the construction plan. The following were the key considerations: 

*	Ensure the safety of the structure throughout deconstruction and construction while adhering to the NBCC ULS and SLS design
*	Ensure the availability of construction materials used in the project
*	Minimize deflection of the glass exterior & water pipes located on the bridge roof
*	Minimize interruption of pedestrian and road traffic on & under the bridge
*	Maximize the public use space under the bridge and along Cogswell Street, including the deconstruction of the Cogswell Street on-ramp
*	Minimise the use of construction materials for economic and sustainable benefits

Modelling and Analysis
---

For the Cogswell Redevelopment Program, the main objective of the truss configuration design is to **hold the entire concrete bridge without exceeding the maximum allowable deflection**. Due to the consideration of the constructability that the project consists of multiple construction stages, we developed two designs corresponding to a temporary configuration and a permanent configuration respectively. 

Based on the load condition that calculated by **P.Allard**, I created two structural models with SAP2000 and SketchUp

After defining all load cases and load combinations, the structural analysis indicated that the worst-case scenario is under the load combination of 1.1D+1.5L+0.45W. The cage structure was decomposed into seven groups.In SAP2000, the setting for the Auto-Selection list ranges from  
* W100x19 to W360x990 for the W section, 
* L25x25x3 to L200x200x30 for the WT section, and 
* HSS 32x32x3 to HSS 305x305x13 for the HSS section.

Section group:

The software optimizes the structural behavior and prevents potential failures by selecting suitable truss sizes that can resist the worst-case scenario.  The default design code is based on CSA S16-14.

After defining the geometry and size of trusses, the model passed to SAP2000 for further check

Detailed Design
---

A detailed connection design follows the SAP 2000 frame analysis. First, the results of the analysis data are exported to a Microsoft Excel file. SAP 2000 exports analysis results in a tabular format. Each row in the table corresponds to a point on an individual frame element and the loads acting at that point.

Summary of maximum forces in all truss members

Following the decision to design our connections as basic welded & bolted gusset plate connections, conceptual drawings are drafted using Google SketchUp to aid visually in the design steps and provide rough sketches & details of the future connections. An example of such is shown in the picture below. The other conceptual connection models done in SketchUp are found in the annex section of this report.
